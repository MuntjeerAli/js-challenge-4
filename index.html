    <h1>Challenge #4</h1>
    <h2>JavaScript Challenges</h2>
    <p>Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
        restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
        300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
    </p>

    <h1>Challenge #5</h1>
    <h2>JavaScript Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
        gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
        Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
        one average score per team).
        A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
        Otherwise, no team wins!

    <h1>Challenge #6</h1>
    <h2>JavaScript Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of
        the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is
        20%.
